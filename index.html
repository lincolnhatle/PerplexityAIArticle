      <h2>What is ML Model Training?</h2>
      <p>
        Model training is the process where an algorithm learns patterns from a dataset by adjusting its internal parameters to improve prediction accuracy. The ML model is a mathematical function whose weights and biases are tuned with input data so it can generalize to unseen examples. Learning occurs through optimization, typically seeking to minimize a loss (error) function that measures prediction accuracy during training.

      <h2>Steps in Training an ML Model</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gather relevant and high-quality data to ensure robust learning outcomes. Models are only as good as the data they learn from.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Preparation and Validation:</strong> Clean and preprocess data—handle missing values, normalize or scale features, and split into training, validation, and testing sets for fair evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis:</strong> Visualization and analysis of datasets clarify relationships and inform model design decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Choose a suitable algorithm depending on the task (regression, classification, clustering, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Training Process:</strong> The model iteratively updates its parameters using optimization algorithms like gradient descent. Performance is monitored on validation data and adjustments to hyperparameters are made as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Assess the model’s performance on unseen (test) data using relevant metrics to gauge generalization ability.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment and Monitoring:</strong> A well-trained model is deployed in production. Continuous monitoring ensures consistent performance and initiates retraining if accuracy drops.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Principles and Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>High-quality, consistent data is essential; poor data leads to poor models.</li>
        <li>Always split data into training, validation, and testing sets to avoid overfitting and ensure generalizability.</li>
        <li>Choose model architectures and hyperparameters that suit the data and problem type.</li>
        <li>Use early stopping and checkpointing during training to save and restore the best-performing model states.</li>
        <li>Optimize model fairness by auditing for data bias and focusing on ethical considerations in ML.</li>
      </ul>
